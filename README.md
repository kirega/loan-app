# Loans App

At the moment this project depends on this [backend](https://github.com/kirega/loan-api) repository to run, 
work is in progress to make it independent.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.2.
If you do not have angular already installed, run this command:

```npm install -g @angular/cli```
## Clone this project
First, get a copy of project by running this command.

`git clone https://github.com/kirega/loan-app.git`

 then change into this directory 
 
 `cd loan-app`
 
## Install Dependencies
Once in the loan-app execute this command:

`npm install`

## Running the server

After all dependencies have successfully installed, start the server by running

`npm start` or `ng serve`

The server should at this url `http://localhost:4200`. 

Navigate to this url on your browser to access your reports.
